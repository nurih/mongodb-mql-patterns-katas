# Common Query Patterns in MQL
## Tutorial - MongoDB World 2022

This repo contains resources for the tutorial.
The talk includes katas - excercises for the audience to practice recognizing document patterns and match up query patterns or pipeline stages.

> No account or login is required. 
> All excercises can be performed directly on Mongo Playground.

The excercises are each in their own folder. Each folder contains a README.md file with the excercise description, and a link to an un-solved MongoDB Playground with the dataaset for the excercise.
Solutions are in each folder in a file named `solution.md`.
